# CENTRAL GITIGNORE - Amsterdam UMC Research GitHub Organization
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file serves two purposes:
#   1. As a .gitignore template for researcher repositories
#   2. As the source for pre-commit and GitHub Action security checks
#
# IMPORTANT: Only patterns between "# BEGIN FORBIDDEN" and "# END FORBIDDEN"
# are enforced by pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions. Everything else is
# convenience-only (helps researchers but won't block commits).
#
